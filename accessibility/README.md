# Accessibility

## Definition

**Computer accessibility** \(also known as **accessible computing**\) refers to the [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility) of a [computer system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_system) to all people, regardless of [disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability) type or severity of impairment. The term accessibility is most often used in reference to specialized hardware or [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software), or a combination of both, designed to enable the use of a computer by a person with a disability or impairment. Computer accessibility often has direct positive effects on people with disabilities.

Accessibility features are meant to make the use of technology less challenging for those with disabilities. Common accessibility features include [text-to-speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_to_Speech), [closed-captioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_captioning), and [keyboard shortcuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcut). More specific technologies that need additional hardware may be referred to as [assistive technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility#cite_note-1)
