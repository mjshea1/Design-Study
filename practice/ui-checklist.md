# UI Checklist

_This UI Checklist is from a ShiftNudge workshop complied by MDS_ - [Original Checklist](https://www.notion.so/UI-Checklist-69dd4bd459d54a51a310dfb0287c60ff)

The top 101 things to consider when designing visually beautiful interfaces. Use this to evaluate any of your designs whether it's homework from this course or your own projects.

## Checklist

### Start

1. Do I have a very solid understanding of the _human_ problem I'm solving with this interface?
2. Is this a low, medium, or high complexity project and have I let that drive my decision for designing a low-fidelity version or not?
3. If I'm using reference material, would I feel comfortable putting my design next to the reference and talking through the areas I used for inspiration, without giving the impression that I copied or create a very close derivative?
4. Have I had the necessary conversations with stakeholders and/or developers about the goal of this project and it's ability to be implemented. In other words, am I aware of business and/or technological constraints?

### Typography

1. Have a chosen font sizes very deliberately \(_ideally 2-4 per screen or section\)_ and pushed myself to use as few as possible?
2. Am I sure there's not a single straggling font size lying around somewhere that could be matched up with another size?
3. Are there any areas where font **weight** would be a better change instead of font size?
4. Are there any areas where font case—whether UPPERCASE, Title Case, or Sentence case—would be more affective that a font size change?
5. Does the visual hierarchy of my typography content match my intentions with what is the most important on the screen?
6. Do my titles and body copy _feel_ right together? Am I playing with type scale in a fun and dynamic way?
7. Have I defined the usage of certain sizes and/or colors for my typography, whether in my own head or specifically written documentation?
8. Are my typographic color choices extrememly well defined, a specific color for links, actions, buttons versus read-only text, and is there anywhere that can be improved?
9. If applicable, are there any areas where I could add more visual interest to my typography by adding any decorative or informational elements in the surrouding area?
10. Have I intentionally chosen a specific typeface for specific reasons?
11. If I haven't used sytem or open source fonts \(SF Pro, Roboto, Inter, Helvetica, etc.\) have I done due dilligence on purchasing the appropriate font licensing and/or checked with stakeholders or developers if the font I've chosen is approved and/or can be used during development?
12. Does the typeface I've chosen convey the right personality or feeling that I want to convey?
13. Have I considered adding the ability for a user to choose their own type size based on their preference, and if not have a made sure that the most important content is no smaller than 16px?

### Layout

1. Have I used the box model concept while laying out out every element of my designs, or are there a few stragglers here and there that I haven't been intentional about?
2. Have I used a clear grid structure with properly aligned elements that visually balance each other out? \(12 column, etc.\)
3. Have I used an intentional implicit grid for all of the negative space surrounding the elements in my layout, especially to define intentional relationships with my content?
4. Does my design have enough negative space?
5. Are there elements in my design where the negative space could double to create a much nicer layout?
6. Does anything feel too crammed or too tight and have I considered layering the information where necessary to create more simplicity?
7. Is all of the text left or right aligned and scannable where applicable?
8. Does my eye have to dart around all over the screen to view the content or is there a nice line of continuation I can pay attention to while viewing?
9. Are my interface elements balanced compositionally with layout anchors?
10. Are there any areas where my designs have been mathematically aligned, but still feel off? Have I correct these with optical alignment?
11. Is the density of my design appropriate? Is it tight and condensed because of the high volume of information? Is it a medium density? Are there ways to add more negative space to have a more open and friendly feel with a lower density layout?
12. Are there any areas where I could create more intentional prioritization of content by using scale or visual weight with background color changes, etc.?
13. Is there appropriate affordance given to the interactive objects on the screen? Is it easy to see what's scrollable, swipeable, tappable, etc.? Are there areas where I know that it could be made more clear
14. Have I fully considered exandable/collapseable or other interactive options for some of the components? Does everything on the screen need to be on the screen or is there a more elegant solution for the content that involves adding another page or another section?

### Color

1. Have a made a concious choice between using HEX codes, RGB values, or HSB/HSL section methods?
2. Have I double checked to make sure that all of my interface elements have appropriate color contrast and meet at least WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards?
3. Have I made a very concious decision about my structural colors versus my interactive colors?
4. Have I clearly defined a primary, secondary, and possibly tertiary CTA \(call to action\) color and used it accordingly?
5. Could my secondary styles and colors be tweaked slightly to better compliment the primary CTA
6. Have I very strategically defined all of my color usages to create an understandable framework for future color usage? Is there room for improvement?
7. Does my color palette follow a systematic and intentional method for color selection based on a base HUE?
8. Is there room to provide a secondary HUE for structural or interactive colors or is the one I've chosen adequate?
9. Is there any opportunity for using a well-placed gradient? If I'm using a gradient have I double checked that any text used in combination with it is accessible?
10. Have I specifically chosen a very strict set of greys, if applicable, for my entire project across every screen?
11. Are there any greys that are very close in color that could be combined and simplified?
12. Have I revised and/or adjusted my overall color palette to include all colors and usages of those colors for every single element?
13. Have I considered the Z-axis of my layout and how white, grey, and darker colors create a natural depth? Are the objects closest to my foreground the lightest in color?
14. If my UI is dark in color, have I been extremely concious with the overall contrast and meticulously chosen each color?
15. If my UI is dark in color, have I reserved absolute white and absolute black for specific pieces of the interface? Is there any room for almost black or almost white, with subtle changes in color?

### Style

1. Have I conciously decided on a specific design direction?
2. Can I intentionally describe my designs with specific adjectives?
3. Have I considered the constraints of the medium I'm designing for and how that should and will affect my designs?
4. Have I very consciously chosen specific corner radius styles? Should they be hard edge, slightly rounded, very rounded, pill-shaped?
5. If I have chosen specific corner radius styles for modules, buttons, etc. have I explored other options to see if there are better alternatives that specifically map to the type of style I'm trying to achieve?
6. Have I very specifically chosen a certain type of border or divider for my content?
7. Have I consider using only negative space to create a separation of content rather than relying on a line or separate modules?
8. Have I made sure my borders or dividers don't overpower the actual content? Could they be toned down to shift focus on the most important areas of the designs?
9. Have I considered depth, lighting, and shadow to the best of it's potential? If I'm using any type of depth as a metaphor, are my darkest elements going back into the design and my brightest elements coming forward intentionally?
10. Have I strongly considered how my buttons are interacted with? Hover states, tapped states, etc. Are there any fun animations that I could add to double-down on the direction I'm trying to achieve?
11. Are my buttons working as hard as they should be to create laser-like focus on the most important actions on the screen when applicable?

### Imagery

1. Knowing that great imagery will make my designs 10X better than subpar imagery, have I intentionally chosen, selected, sourced, or created the absolute best possible imagery for my designs \(if applicable\)?
2. Does the imagery I'm using make my designs better or is it distracting?
3. Am I intentionally using a static image in my designs that will never change, or is there an opportunity to create something more dynamic based on events or user action?
4. Are there places in my design where I can leverage emoji \(like on these checklist titles\) to create a more unique design?
5. Am I using a rasterized bitmap image when I could be using CSS or an SVG in place of it?
6. If I'm using dynamic imagery in my designs, have I stress-tested for all black or all white images to make sure the design still works?
7. If my designs contain user-generated content, have I carefully considered empty states, the ability to change the imagery, the ability to create and/or upload the imagery?
8. Are there smart defaults that look nice when no user generate content has been added?
9. Am I using any imagery that is only "so-so" and not adding great value to the design?
10. Have I paid special attention to any icons used in my project?
11. Are my icons following a strong pattern of size, color, stroke, fill, etc.?
12. Are my icons decorating or interactive and have I made that extremely clear with the designs?
13. Are there any opportunities to create a simple custom illustration \(line, shape, pattern, etc.\) to add more visual interest to the design?
14. Have I considered how the products marketing site or branding should or will impact the interface?
15. Is there an app store icon that needs to be designed? Are there opportunies to create a fun branded experience between the app icon, the loading screen, and the default view of the first time a user launches the app?
16. If I'm designing a website have I designed a custom favicon that shows up in the browser tab and as an extra little detail for my project?

### Elements \(Components\)

1. Does my project have a clear navigation structure and ideally prioritize the top 5 or fewer links or sections?
2. Have I strongly considered how my input fields function \(default, hover, focused, disabled, error, etc.\) and created a very clear state design for all possibilities?
3. Do my input fields match the overall style and direction of the project?
4. Are the forms I've designed absolutey necessary and require the most critical information?
5. Have I very clearly communicated the reasons for requiring certain information?
6. If applicable, have I made it clear that certain pieces of information are required for the progress of the user through the app or site?
7. Have I considered all the variables and/or error states if some information is not gathered properly?
8. If my project has user profiles, have I considered what it will look like the first time it's used, after information has been added? Are the mechanisms for editing information abundantly clear or is there room for improvement?
9. Have I carefully considered the implications of a settings screen?
10. Have I done the hardwork of creating smart defaults for the user and not used the settings screen as a dumping ground for all possible changes?
11. Have I carefully chosen lists and/or card-based layouts in my designs based on the volume of information?
12. Are the any missing components to my designs that might not be needed now, but could be very useful in the future, eg. table designs, etc.?
13. Have I considered the states and function of all of my components and created a well-organized file system?
14. Is there a need to turn my clean and organized file-system into an actual design system to be used for other projects?
15. Are there more people on my team \(stakeholders, developers, etc.\) who need visibility into the choices I'm making for naming components, etc. and should they have an opinion or a say into what things are called as well?

### Tactics

1. Have I explored LOTS of alternative versions of what I'm trying to design and by process of elimination decided on what works best?
2. If my project is slightly more complex than the average project, whether because of features or team size, have I spent enough time getting everyone on board with how the app should function by using low-fidelity designs?
3. If my project is a web-based project, have I fully considered the mobile version and used that as a way to force prioritization of features and layout?
4. If my project is an application, have a used a mobile-first approach to create simplicity up front?
5. If my project is more of a marketing site, have I designed and explored really nice and impactful desktop versions before confining myself too much with mobile versions?
6. If my project is an iOS app, have I made intentional decisions about where to follow the Apple HIG \(human interface guidelines\) or where to deviate from it? If I've deviated, do I have a VERY good reason to do so and are the stakeholders and developers OK with this?
7. If my project is an Android app, have I made the decision to exclusively use a material design system, or do I have strong reasons for not doing that?
8. Have I used very intentional placeholder copy and/or images in my designs that could support specific users, etc.?
9. Have I told a story with my designs \(based on features\) and could I effectively present my designs using what I've created?
10. Are my designs organized in a clear way to showcase specific features and flows?
11. Have I created the necessary prototypes to experiment with animations and interactions?
12. Do I need to create any separate prototype flows to describe certain functionality to stakeholders or developers?
13. Have a been an excellent communicator from the very beginning of the project and now that's it's time to hand off the design, I already know what my developer needs?
