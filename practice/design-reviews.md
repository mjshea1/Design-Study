## Rules for Design Reviews

This was taken from a colaberative workshop at Rockwell. It was great to address these before the meeting started

1. **Choose your own level of participation and disclosure.** Accept personal responsibility for getting our of the session what you need.
2. **Listen to understand rather than to respond.** List for the music as well as the words.
3. **Say what is true for you, while being respectful of others.** Each person's perspective adds value to the group.
4. **Give yourself and others permission to not make sense.** Learning occurs though exploring our confusions and apparent contradicions.
5. **Honor confidentiality. Share your feelings without putting others at risk.** Ask for and gain persmission before continuing a conversation.
6. **Become "comfortable" being "uncomfortable".**
7. **Permission to respectfully accpet or reject anything in the session.** This is not about changing your personal values, but broadening your perspective and/or understanding by being open to hearing other points of view.
8. **Don't dominate the conversation.** Be aware of how much you are contributing and let others have a moment to speak as well.
