# Introduction

Hi! I’m Matthew Shea, a UI/UX Designer and creative leader. I’ve spent 15 years as a designer at award-winning software design & development studios, universities, newspaper publications, and agencies.

As a designer, I am most excited by creatively solving problems in user interface challenges—problems that need to be broken down, questioned, and reassembled with meaning. I believe aesthetics and usability can give a competitive advantage in today’s overpopulated market, something that is often underutilized. 

UI and UX are the fundamental keys to creating a lasting emotional connection with users. As I increase my knowledge and skills I am creating this personal wiki to store what I learn.
