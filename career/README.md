# Career

### User Experience Designer

The User Experience Designer or Interaction Designer is the user’s advocate, and is mainly in charge of taking care of how the product feels. As somebody who is everywhere and doing everything, this broad skill set transforms this position into a generalist role, in charge of dealing with important aspects such as research, ideation, and user testing, as well as wireframes and lo-fi mockups.

### UX Researcher, User Researcher or UX Psychologist

The UX Researcher is also a user’s advocate, but is specially focused on research, synthesis, ideation, and user testing. As a specialist, the UX Researcher collects user data and insights with qualitative and quantitative research methodologies, extracts them to useful and meaningful initiatives, and generally takes care of the pains and gains of the user.

### UX Architect, Information Architect \(IA\) or UX Engineer

The role is about user-advocating, and is all about understanding the pains and gains of using your product. The difference is that a UX Architect is mainly concerned about information architecture \(IA\) — how to arrange information in order to be accessible and understandable. This role is especially important and a very essential complement to a team, particularly if the application is extensive, multilayered, and complex.

### IxD or Interaction Designer

The IxD collects insights from the UX Researcher/UX Designer and crafts the blueprint/mockup/prototype out of them in order to subsequently test ideas on users together with the UX Designer/Researcher. The IxD works with wireframe tools such as Axure, Balsamiq or a whiteboard, and knows UX Design patterns by heart.

### UX Program Manager, Design Program Manager or Design Manager

As a UX Program Manager, you’ll often find yourself multitasking between projects, working between shipping the perfect user experience and reaching the committed goals. Next to being a user advocate and a stakeholder, you are also an advocate of the design team.

### User Interface Designer

The UI Designer is a specialist role that bridges the UX Designer and the Engineers. They take care how the product looks. The main focus lies in the creation of appealing user interfaces, based on the research of the User Experience Designer or UX Researcher, as well as the business-goal aligned roadmap created by the product manager. The UI Designer is also a user advocate, and tests, from time to time, hi-fi designs in usability tests. An eye for pixel perfection, a sense of typography and color, and the competence of creating and scaling a consistent and logical design system make this position a mandatory role in every design-led organization. The UI Designer’s final designs guide the engineers in the development phase.

### Product Designer

A Product Designer is a very good match for the pragmatism and creativity of the startup world. As a full-stack designer from product exploration, research, ideation, usability testing, and capable of creating hi-fi design to implementations, the Product Designer can be the magical fairy that fixes all of your problems.

### Motion Designer or Prototyper

Another specialist position, the Motion Designer makes your web or mobile application come alive. This involves anything from micro-animations, positive feedback tools, to more precise functions, such as a loading animation that prepares the user for the next page, or the animation between two screens.

### Brand Designer, Communication Designer, or Visual Designer

The roles above mostly work for marketing, a position where you define the brand and work along already existing brand guidelines, design media campaigns, or assets. You also create print products, illustrate icons, and — sometimes, just sometimes — are involved in creating elements for web applications, such as marketing landing pages.

### VX Designer \(Viewers Experience Designer\)

In a nutshell, VX is like UX, but with motion. VX is a holistic approach, always advocating the user, which also differentiates the role of the motion designer from the VX designer. The VX Designer brings your design language system into life, delivering anything from micro-animations to supportive video implementations.
