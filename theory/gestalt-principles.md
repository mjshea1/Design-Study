# Gestalt Principles

### Similarity

Similarity occurs when objects look similar to one another. People often perceive them as a group or pattern.

### Continuation

Continuation occurs when the eye is compelled to move through one object and continue to another object.

### Closure

A tendency to perceive a set of individual elements as a single, recognizable pattern, rather than multiple individual elements.

Closure occurs when an object is incomplete or a space is not completely enclosed. If enough of the shape is indicated, people percieve the whole by filling in the missing infomation.

### Proximity

Proximity occurs when elements are placed close together. They tend to be perceived as a group.

### Figure and Ground

The eye differentiates an object form its surrounding area. a form, silhouette, or shape is naturrally perceived as figure \(object\), while the surrounding area is perceived as ground \(background\).

Balancing figure and ground can make the perceived image more clear. Using unusual figure/ground relationships can add interest and sublety to an image.

### Common Fate

Elements that move in the same direction are perceived to be more related than elements that move in different directions or are stationary.
