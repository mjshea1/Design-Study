# Theory

## Definition

Design theory is a subfield of **design research** concerned with various theoretical approaches towards **understanding and delineating design principles**, design knowledge, and design practice. It is asking and answering the question “**Why am I designing it this way?**” There should be a answer for this question at every stage of the design process.
