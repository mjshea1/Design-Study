# Version Control

## GitHub with SourceTree

**GitHub:** a development platform and cloud hosting service to host and review code, manage projects and build software   
**SourceTree:** a Git Client that allows you to visualize and manage your repositories though a simplified UI Both programs use Git. Git is an open-sources version control system that was started by Linus Torvalds

#### **Pros:**

* Can create as many versions/ branches as needed
* Conflict resolution
* Modal versioning
* A great deal of documentation, strong community support

#### **Cons:**

* Not built for design files, no comparison
* Need to understand/learn the basics of Git

## Kactus

Advertised as true design version control without having to change tools, ability to manage changes, document work, and keep team in-sync. Tool is similar to SourceTree in function.

#### Pros:

* Can create as many branches and needed
* Integration with GitHub
* Seems like a plug-in for sketch

#### **Cons:**

* Conflict Resolution
* Learning curve - Need to understand basics of Git
* Independent developers – Not a large product team

## Avocode

More robust, it combines a lot of functions other tools provide, it is integrated into your workflow.

**Pros:**

* Has the same abilities as Zeplin
* Layers are automatically exportable
* Prototyping
* Supports multiple design programs
* Ability to collaborate with comments
* Web version, Windows, Mac OS, Linux
* Established company with clear roadmap

#### **Cons:**

* No clean directions on how to manage modified files
* Primary focus is hand off
* Conflict management
* Not start support or documentation

## Abstract

A secured place to version, manage and collaborate Sketch files and Sketch libraries. It also offers design review and hand-off features.

#### **Pros:**

* Always open file from abstract: don’t need to remember to pull or push changes
* Strong community
* Visual representation of active branches and commits
* Handling merge conflict with a visual representation
* Ability to collaborate with comments
* Continuous support and updates

#### **Cons:**

* Always open file from abstract: you’re always working in the cloud or online, can slowdown work time
* Files are stored on their server
* Learning curve
* Only available for sketch
* Difficult to manage external libraries
