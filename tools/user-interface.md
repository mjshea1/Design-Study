# User Interface

## Sketch

Sketch is a vector graphics editor for macOS developed by the Dutch company Sketch B.V. It was first released on 7 September 2010. It is primarily used for user interface and user experience design of websites and mobile apps and does not include print design features. Sketch has more recently added features for prototyping and collaboration. Being only available for macOS, third party software and handoff tools may be used to view Sketch designs on other platforms.
